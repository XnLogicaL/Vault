This page is the official documentation for [Vault](), the superset of [OpenInventory]() made by [@XnLogicaL]().

## What is Vault?

Vault is a strictly typed object-oriented open-source library that can be used for ANY type of inventory system in your Roblox game.
Vault inherits many features present in [OpenInventory](), and even adds more.

## Why Vault?

Vault is NOT a complete inventory system, instead it aims to be the back bone of one. 
It only consists of a back-end, which is has a very powerful API.
